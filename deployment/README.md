# Common Load Testing Deployment Scenarios

[An example](./tendermint-testnet.md) is provided in this folder, using
Ansible, of deploying a multi-node Tendermint test network to a group of remote
machines (e.g. VMs), alongside the [outage simulator
server](../cmd/tm-outage-sim-server/), in order to prepare a load testing
operation for it.
